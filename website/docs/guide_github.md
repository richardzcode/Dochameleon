Dochameleon is aware of GitHub conventions. Follow this steps to quickly create website for your GitHub project.

### Installation

Just make sure run `dochameleon-init` at your project repo root.

```
> cd $path_to_project$
> dochameleon-init
> cd website
> npm run start
```

### Configuration

Modify `siteConfig.js` with your project information, particularly:

* projectName
* title
* copyright
* rootUrl
* baseUrl
* icon
* favicon

### Docs

By default Dochameleon loads docs from `website/docs`. You may copy files over, or just change the config. For example, by GitHub convention it is the `docs` folder under your repo. Add this line to your `website/siteConfig.js`

```
docsDir: '../docs'
```

**Caution:** Do not set docsDir and buildDir to the same path, since building process would remove and add files.

### Assets

In case you have assets like images, put them under `docs/assets` folder of your repo. Dochameleon will keep them so the references still work as usual.

### Home Page

You may want to make README.md as home page instead of the default one.

The library actually has already created a `readme.html` page with your README.md. You may just copy this source code

```
cp node_modules/dochameleon/lib/core/pages/readme.js pages/index.js
```

Now `npm run start`.
